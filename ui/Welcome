Hello, UI Team!

This is your folder on the GitHub repository for your code.

Each team gets a root folder for their code. Use this folder as the root for all of your code.

Here are some links on how to get started with your project using VCS features in common IDEs:

JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA:
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/discover-intellij-idea.html#VCSBasics
(Git support is built in to the IDE, this is how to get started)

Eclipse:
https://eclipse.github.io
(A plugin is available, this is the link to the plugin along with documentation to get started)

NetBeans:
https://github.com/benrbray/AdamBots-FIRST-2013-Robot-Code/wiki/How-To-Use-Git-&-Integrate-Git-With-NetBeans

I recommend IntelliJ IDEA for any Java-related development.

If you're using a different development environment, such as the command line on a UNIX machine, here's a link to get you started with cloning the repository on a CLI:

Direct any questions to me via Slack, email, SMS, or come visit me in 442.

Cheers üçª
